ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS GAME

The application I created using C# language is a simple ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS game. The 
game aims to simulate a two-player game where a user competes against a 
computer. 
Upon starting the game, the user will be prompted to choose between rock, paper, or scissors.
The computer makes its choice randomly using a built-in random number generator.  Each round is 
evaluated based on traditional game rules, and a message is displayed indicating the winner of 
the round along with the current scores.The first player to reach the 3 points will be the winner. 
After a player has reached the 3 points, the game announces the winner, and asks the user 
whether they want to play another match or not. 

The rules of the game are:
- ROCK beats SCISSORS
- SCISSORS beats PAPER
- PAPER beats ROCK
